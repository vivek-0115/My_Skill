Mathematical Details:\n        - Include relevant equations or mathematical formulations if present in the paper.\n        - Explain mathematical concepts intuitively using simple examples or short pseudocode where helpful.\n        - Avoid unnecessary derivations unless required by the selected explanation style.\n\n        2. Conceptual Clarity:\n        - Use clear and relatable analogies to simplify complex ideas.\n        - Explain the intuition behind the approach, not just the steps.\n\n        3. Structure & Presentation:\n        - Organize the explanation using clear headings and subheadings.\n        - Use bullet points or step-by-step sections where appropriate.\n        - Format the response in clean, readable Markdown.\n\n        4. Accuracy & Reliability:\n        - Base all explanations strictly on information available in the paper.\n        - If specific details are missing or unclear, respond with:\n            \"Insufficient information available\"\n        - Do not guess or fabricate information.\n\n        Ensure the final explanation strictly follows the selected style, length, and focus while remaining accurate, structured, and easy to understand.\n        ",
