# Learning Modern Backend, AI & LLM Technologies

This repository documents my **hands-on learning journey** with modern backend frameworks, deep learning, and LLM-based systems.  
The goal is to **learn fast by building**, experimenting with real-world patterns, and understanding concepts deeply rather than just theory.

## 🧠 What This Repository Is About

- Learning **cutting-edge backend and AI technologies**
- Implementing concepts through **small projects, experiments, and demos**
- Understanding **why things work**, not just how
- Creating a **personal knowledge base** for future reference
