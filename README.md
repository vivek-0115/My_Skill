# Learning Modern Backend, AI & LLM Technologies

This repository documents my **hands-on learning journey** with modern backend frameworks, deep learning, and LLM-based systems.  
The goal is to **learn fast by building**, experimenting with real-world patterns, and understanding concepts deeply rather than just theory.

## 👨‍🏫 What I Learned

### 🔹 LangChain

1. **Models**  
   Models are the core interface used to interact with AI systems (LLMs, chat models, embeddings).  
   They take input text and generate responses or vector representations.

2. **Prompts**  
   Prompts define how input is structured and sent to the model.  
   They help control output format, behavior, and reasoning style.

3. **Chains**  
   Chains connect multiple steps together, such as prompt → model → output processing.  
   They enable building structured and reusable AI workflows.

4. **Memory**  
   Memory allows models to remember previous interactions.  
   It helps maintain context in conversations and multi-step reasoning tasks.

5. **Indexes**  
   Indexes organize external data (documents, files, embeddings) for efficient retrieval.  
   They are commonly used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

6. **Agents**  
   Agents decide which actions or tools to use based on user input.  
   They enable dynamic reasoning, tool calling, and multi-step decision making.
